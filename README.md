HTML Recipe Page

This project is a lightweight recipe website created using only HTML.  
The goal is to practice semantic markup, accessibility, and clean structure without relying on CSS or JavaScript.  

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated:
- HTML Fundamental: Structuring content with headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
- Semantic Markup: Using proper tags for clarity and accessibility.
- Documentation Skills: Writing a clear README to explain the project purpose and workflow.
- Version Control: Managing the project with Git, including staging, committing, and pushing changes.

Self-Reflection (after completion)
Working on this landing page allowed me to:
- Strengthen my understanding of semantic HTML.  
- Appreciate the importance of accessibility and clean markup.  
- Build confidence in using Git and nano for project setup and documentation.
