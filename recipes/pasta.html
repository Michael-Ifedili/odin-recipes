    <h2>Italian Pasta</h2>
    <p>Below is a step by step guide to Prepared this top notch dish</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>Protein: Lean ground beef is standard, often mixed with ground pork or pancetta for added richness.</li>
     <li>Vegetable Base (Soffritto): A finely diced mixture of onion, carrot, and celery is the traditional base for the sauce.</li>
     <li>Aromatics: Garlic is a common addition, as are olive oil and sometimes butter for sautéing.</li>
     <li>Canned tomatoes (chopped, crushed, or passata) provide the main body of the sauce.</li>
     <li>Wine (red or white) is often used to deglaze the pan and add acidity.</li>
     <li>Seasoning & Herbs: Salt, black pepper, dried oregano, thyme, and bay leaves are typical. Worcestershire sauce is also sometimes added for a savoury kick.</li>
     <li>Spaghetti pasta.</li>
     <li>Parmesan cheese for grating over the top</li>
     <li>Fresh basil or parsley for garnish.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium heat. Add the finely diced onion, carrot, and celery (known as a soffritto base), and minced garlic. Sauté for about 5 to 10 minutes until the vegetables have softened and become fragrant but not browned.</li>
        <li>Brown the Meat: Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the ground beef (and pork, if using), breaking it apart with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Cook until the meat is fully browned and no pink remains. Drain any excess grease if necessary.</li>
        <li>Deglaze the Pan: Pour in the red or white wine (if using) and bring it to a simmer. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan and cook for a minute or two until the alcohol smell has cooked off</li>
        <li>Add Remaining Ingredients & Simmer: Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, beef stock, dried herbs (oregano, basil, thyme, bay leaves), Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover partially, and let it simmer gently. The longer it simmers, the richer the flavour; aim for at least 20-30 minutes, but some recipes call for 1-2 hours or more. Stir occasionally and add water or stock as needed if it becomes too thick.</li>
        <li>Adjust Seasoning: Taste the sauce and adjust the salt and pepper as needed after simmering.</li>
        <li>Cook the Pasta: While the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions until al dente (firm to the bite)</li>
        <li>Combine and Serve: Drain the spaghetti. You can either combine the spaghetti with the sauce in the pot or serve the pasta in a bowl with a generous ladle of Bolognese sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Garnish: Sprinkle generously with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a garnish of fresh basil leaves, then serve hot.</li>
